# Graphql refactor

## Description

This project started as a mern stack app that set up as a traditional REST api. The original code is <a href="https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/solid-broccoli">here</a>

I was tasked with refactoring it into a graphql api that allows the client to make queries and mutations that allow you to execute all of the CRUD operations through the use of global functions that are defined in the server and available in the client. The application retains its functionality and is much more efficient in its basis.
